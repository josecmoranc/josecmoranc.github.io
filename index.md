# 1. About me

Since April 2022 I have been Post-doc Associate at [Hogan's Laboratory](https://hoganlab.umn.edu/) belonging to the Particle Technology Laboratory ([PTL](https://ptl.umn.edu/)) of the University of Minnesota. My domain of research is aerosol science with particular emphasis on multi-scale numerical simulations and experiments involving mainly nanoparticles. During my career I have investigated the following subjects:

* Aerosol particle coagulation (theoretical & numerical)
* New tools to simulate agglomerates and agglomeration (numerical)
* Simulating flame-made particle formation (numerical)
* Characterization of flame-made particles (experimental)
* Fractal-like agglomerate morphology and radiative properties (theoretical and numerical)
* Aerosol metrology (experimental)
* Others (numerical)
