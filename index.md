# Particle technology

## 1. About me and my research contributions

Since April 2022 I have been Post-doc Associate at [Hogan's Laboratory](https://hoganlab.umn.edu/) belonging to the Particle Technology Laboratory ([PTL](https://ptl.umn.edu/)) of the University of Minnesota. My domain of research is aerosol science with particular emphasis on multi-scale numerical simulations and experiments involving mainly nanoparticles. During my career I have investigated the following subjects:

* **Aerosol particle coagulation (theoretical & numerical)**
  - I derived an equation for the coagulation kernel of suspended particles valid in the transition of particle-particle interaction regime from a theoretical approach based on the Langevin equation. The new method reveals a likely universal asymptotic limit (long times) for the kinetics of coagulation. Read [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract6090529) or see [this presentation](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28226.66248) for further details.

  - I have introduced a unified self-preserving size distribution to describe particles formed during coagulation. I found the simultaneous transition in flow (from free molecular to continuum) and agglomeration regime (from ballistic to diffusive) to explain a systematic change in agglomerates morphology when increasing the size of primary particles (this was only experimentally observed before). Read [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.085) for further details.

* **New tools to simulate agglomerates and agglomeration (numerical)**
* **Simulating flame-made particle formation (numerical)**
* **Characterization of flame-made particles (experimental)**
* **Fractal-like agglomerate morphology and radiative properties (theoretical and numerical)**
* **Aerosol metrology (experimental)**
* **Others (numerical)**
