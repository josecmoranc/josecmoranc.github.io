# Aerosol Technology

The domain of Aerosol Technology could be definied as understanding particle synthesis methods (e.g. flame reactor or spark-ablation), particle properties (e.g. size, morphology, chemical composition, and electric charge) as well as the mechanisms explaining their formation in gas phase (nucleation, surface growth, oxidation, and coagulation), and processing (e.g. sampling, filtration) to develop technological applications. Such technological applications involve catalyzers, plasmonic materials for health treatment, sensors, coatings, drug-delivery carriers, among others.

## 1. About me and my research contributions

Since April 2022 I have been Post-doc Associate at Prof. Chris [Hogan's Laboratory](https://hoganlab.umn.edu/) belonging to the Particle Technology Laboratory ([PTL](https://ptl.umn.edu/)) of the University of Minnesota, USA. Previously, I was visiting researcher at the Energy and Particle Technology Laboratory ([EPTL](https://carleton.ca/eptl/)) working with Dr. Reza Kholghy at Carleton University in Canada. I obtained my PhD in Physics in November 2021 at [CORIA laboratory](https://www.coria.fr/le-labo/), my advisor was Prof. Jérôme Yon under Normandy University in France. I conducted my undergraduate studies at _Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María_ in Chile and carried out a MSc thesis in the [EC2G](https://ec2g.usm.cl/2022/) (energy conversion and combustion group) where my advisor was Prof. Andrés Fuentes. My domain of research is aerosol technology with particular emphasis on multi-scale numerical simulations and experiments mainly involving nanoparticles. During my career I have investigated the following subjects:

### Aerosol particle size and electric charges (experimental)
  - I measured the 2d distribution of size and electric charge of KCl particles aerosolized in a wind tunnel connected in-line to an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In this context, particles get electrically charged by a corona discharge in the ESP and sampled downstream this device. I formulated the mathematical problem to be inverted for particle measurements based on two different experimental setups: (1) using a tandem-DMA (differential mobility analyzer) method for particles within the 50 to 250 nm diameter, and (2) using a DMA-APS (aerodynamic particle sizer) for particles in the 0.3 to 20 µm diameter. I developed numerical codes for conducting the inversion of these measurements. Also, I modeled the particle size-charge distribution based on a population balance model taking the field- and diffusion-charging into account. In this work I observed that the measured unipolar charge distribution were accurately fitted by a Gaussian distribution and developed a theoretical explanation for this observation. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2023.118578) for further details.

### Aerosol particle coagulation (theoretical & numerical)
  - I derived an equation for approximating the coagulation kernel of suspended particles valid in the transition of particle-particle interaction regime from a theoretical approach based on the Langevin equation. The main novelty of the work is the analytical link between the Langevin equation and particle coagulation kernels in the transition regime. In this work I also conducted population balance simulations of aerosol particle coagulation and the new method reveals a likely universal asymptotic limit (long times) for the kinetics of coagulation. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract6090529) or see [this presentation](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28226.66248) for further details.

  - I have introduced a unified self-preserving size distribution (generalized Gamma distribution) to describe particles formed during coagulation. I found the simultaneous transition in particle-flow regime (from free molecular to continuum) and particle-particle regime (from ballistic to diffusive) to explain a systematic change in agglomerates morphology when increasing the size of primary particles (similar observations were only made experimentally before). See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.085) for further details.

### New tools to simulate agglomerates and agglomeration (numerical)
   - **FracVAL:** It is a tunable code to generate fractal-like agglomerates with prescribed fractal dimension, fractal prefactor, number of primary particles, and primary particle polydispersity. It is the first code able to take the polydispersity of primary particles into account in a rigorous way for a wide range of fractal parameters. It has been highly appreciated by different research groups around the world and the code has been used for particle-light interaction, particle hydrodynamics, morphology, and particle technology applications. The new version of this code including raspberry-like agglomerates and a self-avoiding random walk model for protein morphology. It will also include a module for numerical TEM image generation as I explain in [this presentation](https://gitlab.com/jmoranc1/fracval_cpp/-/blob/master/documents/JMoran_FracVAL_2021.pdf) and will be available through this [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/jmoranc1/fracval_cpp). In the same article, coworkers and I have introduced a volume-based pair correlation function to describe the morphology of agglomerates of nanoparticles. This method was adapted to more complex aggregates during my PhD thesis. This method has also been used by researchers interested in the morphology of liquid atomization particles (see the citations of [FracVAL paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.01.015)). The original code (in Fortran) is publicly available [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mgf8wdcsfb.1).

   - **MCAC:** The Monte Carlo Aggregation Code is a discrete element modeling (DEM) approach to simulate nanoparticle coagulation. I discovered an optimized way to solve the Langevin equation, which is analogous to the DSMC used to solve the Boltzmann equation used in fluid mechanics. I derived a new particle persistent distance (also called stoping distance) and its corresponding time-step to have good agreement with Langevin Dynamics. I validated the method theoretically based on a description of particle dynamics as random walks derived from a binomial statistical approach. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.039) for further details. This code is avaialable through [CORIA-CFD GitLab](https://gitlab.coria-cfd.fr/MCAC/MCAC).

### Simulating flame-made particle formation (numerical)
  - I have conducted DEM simulations of particles formation in flames. I have explained the overlapping of primary particles formed in flames. Indeed, a long-standing question for soot formation in flames is if the overlapping of primary particles is linked to sintering or surface growth. I proposed the latter as the explanation as observed based on this simulations using the MCAC code. In this work I was also able to simulate realistic soot particles that highly resemble those observed in experimental TEM images and was able to obtain a detailed morphological characterization of the simulated aggregates under 2 different flame conditions. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105690) for further details. 
![JAS-surface growth](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0021850220301750-fx1_lrg.jpg)

  - One fundamental question regarding flame-made particles formation is related to the unitary sticking probability of particles upon collisions which has been questioned in the literature. I have introduced a potential energy criterion to explain the transition from reaction-limited (sticking probability <<1) to diffusion-limited (sticking probability =1) nanoparticle coagulation regime at high temperatures. Particularly, I focused on a new approach to determine the rebound probability for fractal-like agglomerate collisions. This is the only work in the literature taking the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions into account in DEM simulations of nanoparticles formation under flame conditions. This is also the only work considering the evolution of soot maturity (here mainly manifested through a change in chemical composition and bulk density) into the coagulation kinetics.

### Characterization of flame-made particles (experimental)
  - I have conducted line-of-sight attenuation (LOSA) measurements of soot volume fraction to decide on the particle sampling points in the flame. Once coworkers and I decided on these points, I conducted the thermophoretic sampling experiments and analyzed the data for comparison with the time-resolved light-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII) technique (mainly carried out by coworkers). I considerably improved the accuracy of the thermophoretic sampling technique based on LOSA technique to monitor the sampling in-situ and resolved in space (mm scale) and time (ms scale). This is explained in detail in [this presentation](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.10340.94087). See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117030) for further details.

  - I have analyzed a large database of flame-made particle transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (sampled by coworkers) to obtain morphological parameters of soot particles including their gyration diameter, number of monomers, projected area, among others. Here we studied three different fuels namely ethylene, propane, and butane under different oxygen index conditions. Soot particles observed in these images have generally a fractal-like structure, a primary particle diameter between 5 to 60 nm, a primary particle polydispersity commonly below 1.3 in geometric standard deviation but some cases show larger values. Aggregates gyration diameter polydispersity is much larger and can be in the order of 2.5 in geometric standard deviation. See [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b01301) for further details.

  - Coworkers and I have introduced a horizontal planar multi-angle light-scattering (HPALS) approach for measuring flame-made particle properties _in-situ_ in a diffusion flame. We used a horizontal laser plane (532 nm wavelength) to avoid any volume-of-measurement bias in the data when analyzed at different angles. I conducted the experimental measurements jointly with the first author and also developed the codes for post-processing the raw data including the deconvolution of measurements to obtain radially-resolved data. In this work we have conducted a highly spatially-resolved (51 pix/mm) description of particle properties including their gyration diameter (the main property measured) as a function of the height above the burner and at different radial positions. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111539) for further details.

  - Coworkers and I have measured _in-situ_ the evolution of soot particle maturity (characterized by the power-law exponent of the E(m) as a function of the wavelength) by combining LOSA and emission measurements at four different wavelengths (500, 532, 660 and 810 nm). Thanks to the accurate measurements conducted at the EC2G group (mainly by coworkers) we were able to reveal a detailed map of soot maturity in the flame. In this paper, we also made an effort to review different methods for soot maturity characterization considering organic, graphitic, and amorphous soot particles as shown in the figure below. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.12.049) for further details.

### Fractal-like agglomerate morphology and radiative properties (theoretical and numerical)
  - I have contributed to the development of a generalized model for agglomerates of nanoparticles morphology (volume-based pair-correlation function) that explains the transition of the structure factor from a single primary particle to fractal-like agglomerates. Jointly with the first author, we developed the equations of this work, where I particularly contributed to characterizing the pair-correlation function of primary particles and I conducted the numerical simulations for comparison and using the theoretical equations of this work. This article was selected as cover in the Journal of Aerosol Science and is [available here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105628).

  - We investigated the role played by primary particle polydispersity on the radiative properties of fractal-like agglomerates of nanoparticles. We compared Discrete Dipoles Approximation and the Generalized Multiparticle Mie methods. We thus obtained corrective factors to incorporate into the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans for fractal aggregates (RDG-FA). In addition, we observed an accurate and direct power-law between the radiative force and the aggregates volumetric effective-radius. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proci.2018.07.065) for further details.

  - I have investigated the effect of primary particle polydispersity on the morphological properties of fractal-like aggregates derived from numericel TEM images. I showed analytically this effect based on both Gaussian and Lognormal primary particle size distributions. I explored the Hough Transform algorithm for primary particle detection and the relative-optical-density method to infer the number of monomers from TEM images based on the gray intensity on the images. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.02.008) for further details.

  - Coworkers have characterized soot particles emitted from different sources (e.g. industrial sites and power plants) and compared their measurements with numerically simulated aggregates. The latter was my work by using FracVAL. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57045-y) for further details.

### Others (numerical)
  - Firstly, this topic is out of the domain of aerosol technology but still part of my career so I decided to include it. Secondly, in this work, we intended to explore the economical performance of a small-scale wind farm for residential clients. The idea was to bring a quantitative assessment of the convenience of such projects to guide the public policy (taking increasingly and big popularity) in renewable energy for Chile. See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.02.062) for further details.
