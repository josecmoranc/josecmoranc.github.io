# Numerical codes
Numerical codes for measurements, post-processing experimental data, and different numerical simulations are provided. The latter include population balance simulations of aerosol coagulation, aerosol particle charging, fractal-like agglomerates, Monte Carlo DEM simulations, and Langevin Dynamics

## 1. Computational simulations

* **FracVAL:** Software to generate 3d off-lattice agglomerates of nanoparticles. In Open-access in [Computer Physics Communications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.01.015).  A new version of FracVAL combining C++/Python with a [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/jmoranc1/fracval_cpp), and extending its capabilities is currently being developed.

* **MCAC:** Contributor (physical model development and validation, in C++/Python). A Monte Carlo DEM software to simulate the nucleation, agglomeration, surface growth, and oxidation of aerosol particles. In Open-access at [CORIA-CFD GitLab](https://gitlab.coria-cfd.fr/MCAC/MCAC/).

* **NGDE-cpp:** A nodal Population Balance code to simulate the dynamics of aerosol or colloid suspensions experiencing coagulation. This code is available though the following [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/jmoranc1/ngde_cpp).
    
* **FTP-cpp:** Developer (conceptualization, implementation and validation, in C++/Python). A Langevin Dynamics code to simulate the dynamics of suspended nanoparticles and determine their collision rates based on a first-time-passage approach. This code is available thgough the following [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/jmoranc1/ftp_kernels_langevin_dynamics).

* **LBM-PLF:** A Lattice-Boltzmann coupled with DEM for simulating particle-laden flows is being developed. Currently in a private GitLab repository.

* **Aerosol particle charging:** This is a population balance model for particle charging through 2 mechanisms namely diffusion and field charging. The model also considers the particle electrophoretic deposition in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). This code is available through [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aerosol-Lab/Aerosol_particle_charging_1d_model).
