Here I would like to share some photos and videos of what I consider exciting about my domain of research.

## 1. Agglomerate growth under 2 extreme regimes

* **How?** The photo below shows (in blue) a typical DLCA agglomerate consisting of N_0 primary particles generated by a cluster-cluster approach using [FracVAL](https://josecmoranc.github.io/numerical-codes.html). The agglomerate is subsequently exposed to a total of 16xN_0 monomers (semi-transparent gray color) which are agglomerated by a monomer-cluster approach similar to the DLA algorithms developed by [Witten and Sander 1983](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.27.5686). The main difference with such works is that here I solved the Langevin equation for determining the trajectories of the particles so the particles dynamics may be in the transition from diffusive to ballistic agglomeration regime. The second advantage of solving the Langevin eauqtion is that the dynamics of particles are determined by the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding fluid including its pressure and temperature. So, coming back to the picture below, I used the same pressure (atmospheric) and modeled the agglomeration under what I called flame conditions (temperature of 1700 K) and atmospheric conditions (temperature of 300 K). I also considered a 10 nanometer diameter and 1 micrometer for the particle under flame and atmospheric conditions, respectively. 
* **What?** This lead to two clearly different morphologies. Under flame conditions the resulting aggregate has a much compact structure while under atmospheric conditions the cluster is more elongated and shows more branches. Also, the atmospheric conditions shows a more dendritic agglomerate structure.
* **Why?** The reason these two morphologies are so different is because under flame conditions the monomer-cluster aggregation takes place in the ballistic regime while under atmospheric conditions this process is diffusion-limited. Under ballistic agglomeration, the monomers tend to penetrate more deeply into the growing cluster and therefore produce more compact structures than the diffusion-limited case. Finally, the determination of ballistic or diffusion regime is related to the particle persistent distance which directly depend on the squared root of the ratio between the temperature and the particle diameter. A larger persistent distance compared to the particle sizes will result in ballistic particle movement while the opposite limite results in diffusive movement.

## 2. Could van der Waals forces make agglomerates of nanoparticles more compact?
* **How?** The video below shows the 2d agglomeration of particles whose movements are simulated by solving the Langevin equation.
