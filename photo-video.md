# Photo and video gallery

Here I would like to share some photos and videos of what I consider exciting about my domain of research.

## 1. Agglomerate growth under 2 extreme regimes

The photo below shows (in blue) a typical DLCA agglomerate consisting of N_0 primary particles generated by a cluster-cluster approach using FracVAL. The agglomerate is subsequently exposed to a total of 16xN_0 monomers which are agglomerated by a monomer-cluster approach similar to the DLA algorithms developed by [Witten and Sander 1983](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.27.5686). The main difference with such works is that here I solved the Langevin equation for determining the trajectories of the particles so the particles dynamics may be in the transition from diffusive to ballistic agglomeration regime. The second advantage of solving the Langevin eauqtion is that the dynamics of particles are determined by the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding fluid including its pressure and temperature.
