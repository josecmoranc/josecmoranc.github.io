# Photo and video gallery

Here I would like to share some photos and videos of what I consider some exciting subjects in my domain of research.

## 1. Agglomerate growth under 2 extreme regimes

* **How?** The photo below shows (in blue) a typical DLCA agglomerate consisting of N_0 primary particles generated by a cluster-cluster approach using [FracVAL](https://josecmoranc.github.io/numerical-codes.html). The agglomerate is subsequently exposed to a total of 16xN_0 monomers (semi-transparent gray color) which are agglomerated by a monomer-cluster approach similar to the DLA algorithms developed by [Witten and Sander 1983](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.27.5686). The main difference with such works is that here I solved the Langevin equation for determining the trajectories of the particles so the particles dynamics may be in the transition from diffusive to ballistic agglomeration regime. The second advantage of solving the Langevin eauqtion is that the dynamics of particles are determined by the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding fluid including its pressure and temperature. So, coming back to the picture below, I used the same pressure (atmospheric) and modeled the agglomeration under what I called flame conditions (temperature of 1700 K) and atmospheric conditions (temperature of 300 K). I also considered a 10 nanometer diameter and 1 micrometer for the particle under flame and atmospheric conditions, respectively. 
* **What?** This lead to two clearly different morphologies. Under flame conditions the resulting aggregate has a much compact structure while under atmospheric conditions the cluster is more elongated and shows more branches. Also, the atmospheric conditions shows a more dendritic agglomerate structure.
* **Why?** The reason these two morphologies are so different is because under flame conditions the monomer-cluster aggregation takes place in the ballistic regime while under atmospheric conditions this process is diffusion-limited. Under ballistic agglomeration, the monomers tend to penetrate more deeply into the growing cluster and therefore produce more compact structures than the diffusion-limited case. Finally, the determination of ballistic or diffusion regime is related to the particle persistent distance which directly depend on the squared root of the ratio between the temperature and the particle diameter. A larger persistent distance compared to the particle sizes will result in ballistic particle movement while the opposite limite results in diffusive movement.

## 2. Could van der Waals forces make agglomerates of nanoparticles more compact?
* **How?** The video below shows the 2d agglomeration of particles whose movements are simulated by solving the Langevin equation. I consider van der Waals attractive potentials and a strong (Lennard-Jones) repulsive potential to avoid unphysical overlapping. I also consider that particles agglomerate upon collisions (because van der Waals potentials are not strong enough to keep them together). This simulation was carried out using the [ESPResSo](https://espressomd.org/wordpress/) molecular dynamics code.
* **What?** The video is divided in two parts. In the first part we observe the dynamics of particles forming agglomerates when sliding on the surface of neighbors is allowed. In the second part, I simulate the dynamics of particles avoiding sliding on the surface of neighbors. When I say "sliding" I mean that a pair of monomers can stay agglomerates but they can have relative motion or slide on the surface of the neighbor while in the second case this is forbidden.
* **Why?** Firstly, the surface interaction of nanoparticles is such a difficult subject to measure experimentally that this is a way to explore what actually happens when two nanoparticles are agglomerated. Secondly, when the sliding is forbidden what happens physically between the particles? I hypothesize this may be explained by mechanical interlocking between monomers or another option may be that the surface rugosity of the particles lead to strong van der walls attractions that are not caputured when we simulate primary particle as smooth spheres. Another possible explanation may be that particles form permanent bonds when they are combined upon agglomeration. Similar observations are discussed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/02786826.2014.932942).

## 3. First-time passage simulation of agglomerates collisions including rotation
The video below shows two agglomerates of nanoparticles generated using [FracVAL](https://josecmoranc.github.io/numerical-codes.html). One of them is static at the center of a cubic domain and the second is free to wander around. The latter movement is simulated by solving the Langevin equation for displacement and rotation. This is simulated using my [FTP-cpp](https://josecmoranc.github.io/numerical-codes.html) code. The video ends when both agglomerates collide and therefore agglomeration takes place.

## 4. The resutructuring of a fractal-like agglomerate
The video below shows an agglomerate of nanoparticles generated using [FracVAL](https://josecmoranc.github.io/numerical-codes.html). In the video we observe the thermal restructuring of the agglomerate where primary particles start to approach each other and therefore the cluster restructures to a more compact shape that at the end of the process becomes spherical-like. Particles interact via Lennard-Jones potentials and their dynamics are simulated by solving the Langevin equation.
