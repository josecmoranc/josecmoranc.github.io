# Teaching and Tutorials
The purpose of this site is to share teaching and tutorial material that may be useful especially for early career scientists including Master or PhD students working in the domain of Aerosol Technology.

## 1. Aerosol metrology tutorials
* **Tutorial 001: Wiring DMA, CPC, and DAQ:** In this tutorial I explain how to connect a DAQ controller to a DMA and a CPC for particle size measurements. This is available in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jyJy2eUo-DA).

* **Tutorial 002: Check DMA voltage:** In this tutorial I simply explain how to check the voltage of a DMA using a multimiter and a high-voltage probe. This is available in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JjLOWhJdNq0).

* **Tutorial 003: DMA Calibration:** Prior using a DMA for example to measure particle size, it is important to calibrate the instrument. In this tutorial I explain how to conduct such calibration using PSL quasi-monodisperse particles. This is available in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XtmB4CBCa74).

* **Tutorial: Single DMA Inversion:** In this tutorial I explain how to conduct the inversion of DMA-Scan measurements (also referred to as SMPS measurements). In particular, I show how to take the DMA transfer function, penetration efficiency, and charge fraction into account to conduct the deconvolution process including a Tikhonov regularization to obtain particle sizes when using the experimental setup shown below.
